THE OBJECTIVE
The goal is to get all the cards in one pile

THE PACK
The standard 52-card pack is used.

THE DEAL
The player deals out the cards one by one face up, in a row from left to right,
as many at a time as space allows. (Dealing may be interrupted at any time if 
the player wishes to make a move. After making a move, the deal is then resumed).

THE PLAY
Any card may be placed on top of the next card at its left, or the third card at
its left, if the cards are of the same suit or of the same rank.

Example: Four cards, from left to right, are: 6 hearts, J hearts, 9 clubs,
9 hearts. The 9 hearts may be placed either on the 9 clubs or on the 6 hearts.
It may not be played on the jack of the same suit because the jack is not to the
immediate left, or third from the left.

When the movement of one or more cards has formed a pile, the entire pile is
moved with the top card.

In the example above, when the 9 hearts is put on the 9 clubs, the two may be 
put on the J hearts and then all of these cards on the 6 clubs. However, it is 
not obligatory to make a particular move if the player prefers not to do so.
